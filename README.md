**Introduction**

HappyBaby is an app that helps expecting parents choose the most important and useful stuff for you child. There is no more looking around for stuff online or checking with friends for details. It will help you to plan for a smooth journey once your baby is here.

This app stems from the personal experience of frantically searching for items while we were expecting. We spoke with family, friends and looked up online to oragnise a list for our LO's (Little One) arrival. The list is arranged in an order of priority to help buy what is the most important and followed by nice to haves.

The most imporatnt challange I came acrosss in this project was to link the databases of the user and prodcuts in such a way that the user cannot manipulate the master data easily.

**Technologies used:**
Express JS, Mongoose, NodeJS, (other minor dependencies like uuid, method_override etc.)
HTML, CSS, Javascript

**Suggested Improvisations**
Make the search bar active to let users search the products.
Add reviews to each product.
Add admin role to control changes to the master list by the user.
Custom products and notes for each user.
User status to track the progress of their list.

Part of the CSS is referred online to display the products index.
